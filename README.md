## What is it good for?

It's general purpose. Do anything you want, on any platform you want.

First class support (as of mid 2020) for:
* Ubuntu, CentOS, Amazon Linux
* macOS
* i(Pad)OS
* watchOS
* tvOS

Windows support is coming in a near-future milestone.

It can run on a Raspberry Pi, demo here: https://lickability.com/blog/swift-on-raspberry-pi/

## What's it like?

It is safe, fast, and IMO elegant and civilized (especially compared with ObjC)

Supports a REPL (read-eval-print loop) like Lisp, Ruby or Python:

% swift
1> print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
let x = 21*2
x: Int = 42
